    <img width="200" src="image.jpg" alt="">
    <P>Gerbera species are tufted, caulescent, perennial herbs, often with woolly crown, up to 80 cm high. 
        Leaves are all in rosette, elliptical with entire or toothed margin or lobed, petiolate or with a petaloid base, pinnately veined, often leathery and felted beneath. 
        Single to several flowering stems from each rosette bear bracteate or ebracteate, simple, one-headed inflorescence-capitulum. 
        Capitula are radiate, with several rows of bracts. Ray florets are female, 2-lipped, the outer lip is large and strap-shaped, inner lip consists of two small, thread-like lobes of white, pink or red, rarely yellow colour. 
        Disc florets are fertile, five-lobed and irregularly 2-lipped with curled petals.</P>
